    The core trigonometric functions represent ratios of the sides of a right triangle. These functions consist of sine(sin on a calculator), cosine(cos on a calculator), and tangent(tan on a calculator). They are used to relate the angles of a triangle with its sides. To learn more about these functions and how they are represented, click on one of the links below to see how each one works.<br><br>
