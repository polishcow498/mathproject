        The cosine ratio is the ratio of the adjacent side of the unknown angle to the hypotenuse, represented by cosÎ˜ = adjacent/hypotenuse. The final ratio is the tangent ratio, which you can go to directly from <a href="">here</a>, or if you want to go back to the main page, click <a href="Project SOHCAHTOA.html">here</a>.
